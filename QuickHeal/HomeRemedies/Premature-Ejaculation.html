       <p>Premature ejaculation is said to occur when a man ejaculates before either partner attains satisfaction. It is generally not a cause for worry if it occurs infrequently. But men who experience premature ejaculation regularly may suffer from reduced confidence and low self-esteem. It can also lead to relational conflicts. Premature ejaculation is a common complaint that affects a large number of males from time to time. Studies show that 1 out of 3 men may suffer from this condition at some point in their life. The causes of premature ejaculation may be a combination of physical and mental factors. Although many men refrain from seeking treatment due to embarrassment, it must be noted that this is a treatable condition. Treatments for premature ejaculation include medication, counseling and sexual techniques. In most cases, a combination of therapies works well.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="symptoms">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Symptoms of Premature Ejaculation</h2> 
       <p>The main symptom of premature ejaculation is the incidence of ejaculation that takes place earlier than both partners would like. This may then lead to feelings of stress or worry. The condition can even occur during masturbation. Premature ejaculation may be categorized as primary or lifelong and secondary or acquired. Primary or lifelong premature ejaculation is said to occur when a man ejaculates within a minute of vaginal penetration. The man may also be unable to delay ejaculation and negative feelings of frustration and avoidance may develop as a result. Secondary or acquired premature ejaculation has the same symptoms as primary premature ejaculation except for one. It occurs after a man has had satisfying sexual interactions previously without facing any problems in ejaculation. Premature ejaculation does not lead to any serious health complications, although it may contribute to concerns in personal life. A strained relationship is a common outcome of premature ejaculation. It may also lead to problems in fertility and may make it difficult for a couple to conceive. If the condition is not treated properly, it may become necessary for a couple to undergo fertility treatment. </p>
       <p> It is advisable to consult a doctor if ejaculation occurs prematurely during most sexual interactions. Many men feel that they will be able to rectify the problem themselves, but it helps to discuss the matter with a doctor and seek treatment if necessary.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="causes">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Causes of Premature Ejaculation</h2> 
       <p>The exact causes of premature ejaculation are not completely understood, but there are several factors that could contribute to the problem. In the past psychological factors were thought to be the main cause, but research has now shown that there is likely to be interplay between different biological and psychological factors. It is believed that previous sexual encounters may lead to a pattern which later on becomes difficult to alter. Hurrying to reach a climax or experiencing guilt during sexual interactions may result in ejaculation problems later on in life. Premature ejaculation may also be linked to erectile dysfunction wherein the anxiety about maintaining an erection during sexual intercourse may lead to hurried ejaculation. Anxiety about oneÂs sexual performance or any other issues may also contribute to early ejaculation. If premature ejaculation has never occurred before, it is advisable to examine oneÂs current relationship closely. It is possible that interpersonal problems between partners could be triggering the problem. </p>
       <p> Biological factors that may be involved in premature ejaculation include hormonal imbalances, imbalance in the levels of neurotransmitters or brain chemicals and thyroid issues. Heredity and ailments that affect the prostate may also be a cause of the condition. In very rare cases, premature ejaculation may be associated with damage to the nervous system and withdrawal from certain medications.</p>
       <p> There are some factors that can increase a manÂs risk of premature ejaculation. These include erectile dysfunction, wherein the anxiety over loss of erection may lead to hurried sexual encounters. Health problems may also cause an individual to feel stressed during sexual encounters and this could lead to unconscious premature ejaculation. Strain and stress due to mental or emotional factors may also affect sexual performance.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">

       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Remedies for Premature Ejaculation</h2> 
       <p>The treatment for premature ejaculation may include medication, psychological counseling and sexual therapy. Certain types of antidepressants are used to treat premature ejaculation. These medications may have to be tried out in different doses in order to find the one which suits you best. Intake of antidepressants leads to delayed orgasm as a side effect. Therefore these medications are often recommended for men who experience premature ejaculation. Doctors may prescribe different types of selective serotonin inhibitors which help to delay ejaculation. These may produce effects after about ten days. Tricylic antidepressants may be prescribed in case the problem is still not resolved. These medications may not have to be taken daily. Your doctor may advise you to take a small dosage many hours before sexual intercourse as this will be helpful in tackling the problem. It must be kept in mind that antidepressants are not approved as a treatment for this condition. They are known to be effective because they lead to the side effect of delayed orgasm. Therefore it is important to discuss with your doctor regarding the benefits and risks of these medications. <br /><br /> Anesthetic creams which can be applied topically are also sometimes used. Such applications reduce the sensation in the penis and this helps to delay ejaculation. They must be applied a short while before sexual intercourse and are wiped off after sensation has been dulled enough to delay ejaculation. However in some cases, sexual pleasure may be decreased due to the lowered sensitivity. Also, some studies have shown that female partners may experience reduced sensitivity in the genital area even after the anesthetic solution is wiped off. In some rare cases, these topical applications may result in an allergic reaction.</p>
       <p> Counseling for men suffering from premature ejaculation includes cognitive behavioral therapy. This involves discussing with the mental health provider about oneÂs experiences and interpersonal relationships. Done in regular sessions, this type of therapy helps to alleviate feelings of anxiety and enables one to cope with stress. Psychological counseling is effective when used along with medications.</p>
       <p> Sexual therapy for premature ejaculation involves taking certain steps before sexual intercourse so that ejaculation can be delayed. One such method of sexual therapy is the squeeze technique. In this technique, the partners must begin sexual activity involving penile stimulation until the man is on the verge of ejaculating. Then the man or the partner must squeeze the end of the penis and hold for some time until the urge subsides. After about 30 seconds, foreplay may resume again. Squeezing the penis reduces the erection and when sexual arousal occurs again, a full erection is achieved. In case the man feels the urge to ejaculate again, the squeezing method may be repeated. This may be done until the man is able to achieve vaginal penetration without ejaculating.</p>
       <p> In cases where premature ejaculation is primarily caused due to relational conflicts between the partners, proper communication is essential. Both partners should discuss their anxieties and problems and should also be ready to try various approaches to resolve the issue. This will help to reduce stress and performance anxiety to a large extent. It is important not to place blame and to approach the problem in a supportive and loving way. Couples that are not able to resolve their problems on their own should consult a doctor who can then recommend therapy.</p>
       <p> Alternative treatments such as acupuncture are also known to help in treating premature ejaculation and other types of sexual dysfunctions. Many individuals also experience improvement through herbal remedies. Passiflora or passion flower is known to have a calming effect on the physical and mental state of a person and thus enables one to have better control over sexual excitement. This is beneficial in preventing premature ejaculation. The herb ginseng is also widely known for its positive effects on hormonal levels in the body. The flow of blood to the penis can be improved with the help of the herb, ginkgo biloba. This enables a man to have a proper erection and also enhances sexual endurance.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="diet">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Diet for Premature Ejaculation</h2> 
       <p>The diet for those who suffer from premature ejaculation should consist of vitamins and minerals, blueberries, cereal and eggs. Eggs contain the vitamins A, B, D and E along with minerals such as zinc, selenium, calcium and iron. Eggs also supply the body with cholesterol which helps in producing the sex hormones. Cereals contain folic acid which enhances blood flow and prevents blockage of the arteries. When there is a healthy flow of blood to the penis, attaining and maintaining an erection becomes easier. Blueberries also improve blood circulation to the genital region. However they must be eaten in moderation as excessive amounts can result in diarrhea.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="suggestion"></a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Suggestion for Premature Ejaculation</h2> 
       <p>The intake of certain drugs may contribute to premature ejaculation. Some drugs affect the functioning of the chemical messengers in the nervous system and this may lead to early ejaculation. Drugs that belong to the psychoactive group are known to cause premature ejaculation. These include stimulants that are administered to individuals with psychic disorders and hypnotics that may be used for recreational purposes due to their euphoric effects.</p> ï»¿
