       <p>Breathing is one of the most basic yet important functions that our body performs. Most of us do not even give a minutes thought to our breathing patterns, when everything is normal. However, for some individuals, breathing can be quite a task, especially if they suffer from some type of respiratory disease.</p> 
       <p>Respiratory disease is a broad term that can be used while referring to a series of conditions that affect the respiratory system in the human body. Therefore, any condition that affects your lungs, bronchial tubes, upper respiratory tract, trachea, pleural cavity or even your nerves and muscles that you use for breathing can be termed as a respiratory disease. There are several different types of respiratory diseases that you can suffer from and the severity of each type may vary. Some of the common types of respiratory diseases include inflammatory lung diseases, obstructive lung diseases, restrictive lung diseases, respiratory tract infections, pleural cavity diseases and pulmonary vascular diseases. Each of these respiratory problems can be further divided into subconditions, which could affect one or more part of your respiratory system. Some of the respiratory diseases are fairly mild and self-limiting, like the common cold. However, several forms of respiratory diseases like pulmonary embolism or bacterial pneumonia could also be life-threatening, if not checked and controlled in time. </p> 
       <p>Studies indicate that certain respiratory diseases are a leading cause of illnesses and death in the United States. In a year, approximately a billion people are afflicted with a common cold at least once. Given below is a list of the different respiratory diseases that are prevalent across the country: </p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Acute respiratory distress syndrome </li> 
        <li>Asthma </li> 
        <li>Cancer (small cell lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma and mesothelioma) </li> 
        <li>Common colds </li> 
        <li>Cystic fibrosis </li> 
        <li>Emphysema </li> 
        <li>Infections like laryngitis, otitis media, sinusitis, pharyngitis and tonsillitis </li> 
        <li>Pneumonia </li> 
        <li>Tuberculosis </li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>There are many different ways in which respiratory disease can be classified. First of all, it is important to consider the organs that are affected. Of course, the causes of the condition, as well as the pattern of the symptoms play a very important role in the classification too. Some of these diseases last for no more than a few days and do not require medical treatment. However, other diseases could last for a longer period of time and may not get better, without proper medical treatment. Therefore, it is important to consult a doctor, in case any of the symptoms of respiratory diseases become evident.</p>
