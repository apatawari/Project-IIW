       <p>Schizophrenia is a mental health condition in which there is a complete breakdown of the normal thought process and the emotional responses to different conditions. As a result an individual who suffers from schizophrenia displays a bizarre manner of interpretation of reality. The cognitive processes are severely compromised. Hallucinations, illusions, delusions and incoherent speech and thinking are commonly observed in schizophrenics. Schizophrenia is not to be confused with split personality or multiple personality disorder. The terms schizophrenia and multiple personality disorder or split personality are often used interchangeably. This however is a common mistake, as schizophrenia is not a dissociative identity disorder such as split personality or multiple personality wherein the person manifests different identities. Schizophrenia primarily affects thinking and this distorted cognition leads to emotional and behavioral complications. </p>
       <p> It may come as a surprise to you, but schizophrenia is really not uncommon, with as many as 24 million people afflicted with the condition. If youre in your forties or fifties it may be a welcome change to find that youre not in the high risk group for a change, as the condition typically afflicts younger adults, between the ages of 15 and 35. Schizophrenia is treatable, but the effectiveness of treatment varies, depending on how early you begin treatment. Keep in mind that schizophrenia is a chronic disorder, which is why the prevalence of the disease is also high. The stages of schizophrenia are the prodromal stage, the acute stage and the residual stage. The first stage is the stage before the condition manifests itself actively. In the acute stage, the symptoms such as hallucinations, illusions and delusions are extensive. The last stage or the residual stage is when the patient does not have any active symptoms after treatment, but may show signs of depression, and have ideas or thoughts that may be strange. Each patient manifests signs of the disease differently. Some schizophrenics may have only a single episode of the disease whereas others may suffer from several episodes.</p>

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Symptoms of Schizophrenia</h2> 
       <p>Warning signs may appear quite early especially in the prodromal stage of this disease. However a warning sign may not necessarily confirm the presence of schizophrenia. A warning sign may also point out to another mental disorder. However, a common warning sign of this illness is self isolation, clumsiness and unclear speech. When the symptoms are fully developed the illness can be easily identifiable. Symptoms are of three types  positive symptoms, negative symptoms and cognitive symptoms.</p> 
       <p>Positive symptoms are those symptoms that hamper normal functioning of an individual. Hallucinations, delusions, distorted thinking and strange behavior are positive symptoms. Delusions are false beliefs and hallucinations involve the visual and auditory perception of things that are not really there. Negative symptoms are signs that show the lack of a normal behavior. Social isolation, emotionless behavior, clumsiness, inability to fulfill activities, lack of interest in daily activities and indifferent behavior are different negative symptoms. Negative signs often manifest much before the onset of positive symptoms. Cognitive symptoms are related to the thought process. Hampered thinking, interpretation, memory loss, lack of focus or concentration and the inability to process information in a normal way can impede normal functioning to a large extent. </p> 
       <p>Other symptoms of schizophrenia could include mood and emotion problems and other behavioral problems. The patient may have extreme mood swings, being ecstatic one moment and severely depressed the next. Suicidal feelings and thoughts are not uncommon. In some cases the symptoms may become so overwhelming that normal functioning is not possible. The patient is incapable of performing even simple day to day activities.</p> 
       <p>Diagnosing schizophrenia is by no means straightforward. The schizophrenic is in most cases unaware of anything untoward. The warning signs are usually noticed by family members and friends. If you suspect that a loved one is suffering for a mental illness it would be best to seek immediate medical help. Mental health practitioners through observation, tests and different criteria diagnose this disease. Other psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders, personality disorders and bipolar disorders also have similar symptoms. Diagnosis is therefore quite tricky and may keep qualified health experts speculating. An accurate diagnosis is however essential for treatment to be started, which is why it is so important to seek out the best health care facilities with experienced and reputed staff.</p>

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Causes of Schizophrenia</h2> 
       <p>The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. It is believed that genetic factors and environmental factors play an important role in the development of this illness. The onset of the illness is during youth. Very rarely will it develop after the age of 40, nor will it manifest itself in childhood although a few latent signs may be present even at childhood. The condition is often diagnosed at around the age of 19.</p> Complications with the chemicals in the brain and neurotransmitters may predispose a person to this illness. Some researchers also believe that there are differences in the brain structures those who suffer from schizophrenia as compared to other healthy individuals. There may also be differences in the functioning of the central nervous system. 
       <p></p> 
       <p>Heredity is a very big influencing factor. A person with a family history of this disorder is highly predisposed to it. Environmental causes include a highly stressful living environment, drug abuse, prenatal stressors. Abuse and trauma in early childhood are other factors. Substance abuse may also lead to the development of schizophrenia. Drug abuse and excessive alcohol intake are significant risk factors. Prenatal stressors include complications during pregnancy. If an expectant mother suffers from depression, stress, or infection then there is an increased risk of schizophrenia developing in the child during adulthood. In general, risk factors include family history of schizophrenia, extremely stressful life events, older age of the father, drug abuse, substance abuse and being exposed to infection, stress and malnutrition during fetal development.</p>

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Remedies for Schizophrenia</h2> 
       <p>Remedies include medical remedies, lifestyle changes and family and community support. Almost half of all patients who suffer from schizophrenia do not get appropriate treatment and therefore their condition worsens. In countries where there is not enough awareness or if there is severe social stigma, the condition of the schizophrenics is appalling. Schizophrenia can be managed and controlled with treatment, but the treatment is life long since it is a chronic disease. Appropriate treatment is important for long term management and to reduce the number of schizophrenic episodes based on the severity of the disorder.</p> 
       <p>Medications are a must for schizophrenic patients. Antipsychotic medications are most commonly administered to schizophrenics. The side effects or health risks posed by these medications can be quite severe and debilitating, but this is one of those scenarios in which the risks are not really avoidable. This to a large extent also explains the reduced life expectancy of schizophrenics. This said, patients and care givers must be informed about the risks posed from medications and also the dosages and other guidelines to be followed. These medications regulate the brains neurotransmitters. In extreme cases, the patient may also need hospitalization.</p> 
       <p>Along with medications, the patient also requires psycho-social treatments. Counseling, family therapy, social and behavioral therapy and community support therapy are all essential to help the patient cope with the illness.</p> 
       <p>Lifestyle changes include helping the patient to reduce anxiety and stress, relaxation techniques, setting simple goals and achieving them and being part of a support group.</p>

       <h2>Suggestion for Schizophrenia</h2> 
       <p>Schizophrenia is a very difficult disease to live with, and causes severe distress to not just the patient, but to the care givers as well. Since it is likely to be a lifelong condition, it is necessary for all involved to be aware of how to manage symptoms and to also be able to recognize the warning signs of an impending episode. A lack of awareness and neglect are the biggest impediments to treatment and management of schizophrenia. </p> 
       <p>Therapy and counseling is extremely important for family members, not just to sensitize them to the needs of the patient, but because the stress and strain that they are subjected to does take its toll. Care givers are in need of as much support as are patients, and without the guidance and counseling of experts or the shared experiences and encouraging stories from those in a similar plight it would be almost impossible to overcome the odds.</p>
