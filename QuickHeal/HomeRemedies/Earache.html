       <h2>Home Remedies for Earache</h2> 
       <p>Earaches should not be self-medicated or left untreated as the condition might worsen and lead to permanent loss of hearing in severe cases. Where children and infants are concerned it is important to visit your doctor at the earliest for a proper diagnosis and medical treatment. Home remedies can be use as complimentary therapy to facilitate the healing and recovery process, or simply for additional relief from the symptoms. Exercise caution when using any of these remedies however, as not all of them are scientifically investigated.</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>A popular earache home remedy is to heat a teaspoon of sesame oil along with a clove of garlic. Remove the garlic clove and carefully put a few drops of the warm oil into the ear canal. Sesame oil warmed with castor plant leaves is also effective in treating earaches. Linseed oil heated with garlic and used in the same way also offers pain relief during earaches. The healing properties of garlic have been verified by vigorous testing.</li> 
        <li>Symptoms of earaches such as fever and pain can be treated with over-the-counter pain medications such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. When treating children, make sure the dosage corresponds to their weight and age. Upon diagnosing the cause of the earache, your doctor may prescribe eardrops or antibiotics to fight off any infection. Steroids may be required to reduce the swelling as well. </li> 
        <li>It is also possible to find relief from ear pain with home remedies for earaches, such as applying a warm compress to the ear. While doing this, take care not to burn the skin by using water that is too hot. It is also important that no liquid enters the ear canal as this can further aggravate the situation. Moisten a ball of cotton wool with Vaseline and place firmly in the ear to keep water out (when bathing or applying a compress). </li> 
        <li>Chewing gum can offer some relief when the pain of a earache gets too unbearable or when high altitude or pressure is causing the ear pain. Infants can suck on a pacifier or a bottle when changes in pressure occur during flight. </li> 
        <li>Sleep in an upright position to avoid pressure building up in the ear canal. </li> 
        <li>Home remedies for ear infections in adults include grinding fresh basil leaves into a paste before heating up the mix until warm. Pour the oil that is formed on heating into the ears, four or five drops at a time. </li> 
        <li>Alternative earache cures such as drops of warm ginger juice or onion juice may be effective if done consistently during a earache. Do this before bedtime for the best results. </li> 
        <li>If regular swimming causes the earache, you can prevent this from happening by coating the ears with a few drops of mineral oil beforehand. This prevents water from collecting in the ear canal and causing the pain. </li>
       </ul> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="diet">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Diet for Earache</h2> 
       <ul>
        <li>Changing your diet to include foods that boost the immune system can prevent chronic earaches and ear infections. Proteins that are rich in amino acids and foods high in omega-3 fatty acids help heal chronic health problems and improve the functioning of the immune system. </li> 
        <li>If your child suffers from chronic earaches it is imperative to cut back on all over-processed meals and junk food. These are full of chemicals and additives that have been proven to have a detrimental effect on your childs overall health and development. Foods high in white sugar are especially toxic to the body. White sugar can encourage the occurrence of fungal infections in the ear, nose, and throat. Replace such unhealthy meals with a balanced healthy diet rich in fresh fruit and vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. Citrus fruit and juices contain vitamin C that builds immunity and reduces congestion in the ears and nasal passages. </li> 
        <li>If the earache is caused by blockages, onion and garlic eaten raw or in supplement form can help dissolve the mucous build up and reduce ear pain. Berries, pineapples, and tomatoes are also good natural solvents of mucous. </li> 
        <li>A number of people who suffer from earaches are also allergic to certain foods such as dairy and wheat. Eliminating these items from your diet completely can make significantly decrease the occurrence of earaches. </li> 
        <li>Experts believe that dairy products produce extra mucous in the sinus and throat that can increase the pressure in the ears. Research also shows that children who have been breast-fed are less likely to develop ear infections. </li>
       </ul> 
       <div class="anchoralign">

       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Suggestion for Earache</h2> 
       <p>If you or your child is suffering from a earache that is accompanied by high fever, dizziness, headache, swelling around the ear, severe pain that suddenly stops, or a weakness and lack of control over the muscles in the face make sure that you seek immediate medical attention. If your child remains fussy and irritable after 24 hours, develops a stiff neck, is very tired and does not stop crying, get him to an emergency room at the earliest. </p> 
       <p> If left untreated, a earache can result in a scarring of the eardrum, permanent loss of hearing, meningitis, paralysis, and speech impediments. </p>

           <p>Use equal parts of apple cider vinegar from health food store and rubbing alcohol. With a dropper fill the ear canal and allow to sit for 5-10 mins. Repeat 3 times daily until the earache is gone.</p>

           <p>Castor oil has been used for centuries for medical remedies. You can warm castor oil in the microwave then drop a couple drops in the infected ear, then place a cotton ball on the ear. Repeat this about 2 times a day for a couple of days. Castor oil is a miracle oil, your ear will be better in no time. It has always worked for my family. You can also heat it up with a garlic clove; strain out the garlic clove then put the oil in ears. This is my preference of choice.</p>

           <p class="MsoNormal">My dad used 1 tsp of fresh urine and instilled in the ear, followed by a cotton ball. As gross as it sounds, my ear ache was gone within 15 minutes, and I have never had an ear ache since. So when all else fails try it, you will be amazed. My grandparents used this as well.</p>
