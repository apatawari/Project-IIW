       <p>As children, we often overheard our grandparents complain of back aches and back pain, and so we tend to associate back pain with old age. However, back pain isnt necessarily a sign of aging and it can afflict just about anyone because of the various possible causes of back pain. You may need to use more than one treatment method for back pain and this will depend almost entirely on the cause of the pain and the nature of the injury. Back pain could refer to any kind of pain that afflicts any area of the back, including the lower, upper, or middle back. Though lower back pain is a lot more prevalent, there are some people who tend to suffer from upper back pain or middle back pain on a regular basis. </p>
       <p> The severity of back pain can vary greatly among different individuals, and while it may simply be a bit of a bother to some, it could be almost debilitating to others. In some cases, the pain could last for a few hours or up to a day, but it is also very common for people to suffer from pain that lasts for days; this is known as chronic back pain. Back pain can at times be indicative of a far more serious back problem and should never be treated lightly. Back pain is one of the most common ailments today and statistics suggest that 85 percent of all adults in the United States will suffer from low back pain at least once in their lifetime. Since you are reading this page, you probably fall into this category and are searching for a cure for back pain. Before you try to find a way to treat your back pain, it is important that you understand the symptoms and the causes of back pain.</p>
       <p> The location and severity of back pain depends on several factors, such as the individuals age, medical condition, level of physical fitness as well as the underlying cause. Fortunately, in most cases, upper, middle or lower back pain does not stem from any serious condition and can be managed with the help of medication, simple remedies, exercises, and so on. Only a serious condition such as a slipped or ruptured disc requires surgery. Diagnosis is therefore one of the most important prerequisites to successful treatment. If you suffer from severe back pain on a regular basis you should consult a doctor for exercises, diet, and lifestyle changes that can help prevent recurrent back pain.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="symptoms">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Symptoms of Back Pain</h2> 
       <p>Back pain is not a condition but it is a symptom of an underlying problem. You may experience back pain due to an injury or a muscle pull. You may also experience accompanying symptoms such as neck pain or headaches depending on the cause of your back pain. It is important for anyone who suffers from frequent back pain to be well informed about the symptoms of back pain. If you do suffer from frequent bouts of back pain or a very severe back pain, it would be advisable to seek a thorough medical diagnosis. </p>
       <p> So what are the common symptoms of back pain? The symptoms of upper back pain are quite varied and may include muscle spasms, discomfort while inhaling, weakness in the arms, restricted neck movements, and a pinching feeling between the shoulder blades. These upper back symptoms could be an indication of an injury to a disc which is in the upper part of the spine. </p>
       <p> Thoracic pain is the term used to describe upper back or middle back pain. Some of the most common accompanying middle back pain symptoms are soreness to the touch, difficulty in performing simple activities, stiffness, and restriction in body movements. </p>
       <ul> 
        <li> One of the reasons that lower back pain is a lot more common than upper back pain is that there are several health problems that could cause this symptom. Conditions that have been known to trigger pain in the lower back include pregnancy, bladder infections, kidney problems, and even cancer. In addition to back pain, pregnancy generally causes: Nausea and vomiting </li> 
        <li> Cravings or aversion towards certain foods </li> 
        <li> Tingling sensation, soreness, and heaviness in the breasts </li> 
        <li> Missed periods </li> 
        <li> Vaginal discharge or spotting </li> 
        <li> Cramps in the abdomen </li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>In the same way, apart from lower back pain, kidney symptoms usually include:</p>
       <ul> 
        <li> Increase in the urge to urinate </li> 
        <li> Changes in the appearance of the urine, as it becomes bubbly or foamy </li> 
        <li> Presence of blood in the urine </li> 
        <li> Swelling in the feet, ankles, face, feet and hands </li> 
        <li> Excess fatigue </li> 
        <li> Rash on the skin or itching </li> 
        <li> Metallic taste in the mouth </li> 
        <li> Shortness of breath </li> 
        <li> Pain in the legs and flanks </li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>Along with lower back pain, bladder symptoms also include:</p>
       <ul> 
        <li> Increased urge to urinate and frequent urination</li> 
        <li> Incontinence Blood in the urine </li> 
        <li> Dysuria or a burning sensation while urinating </li> 
        <li> Foul smell in the urine </li> 
        <li> Cloudiness or other changes in the color of the urine </li>
       </ul> 
       <p> Though rare, back pain can also be an indication of lung cancer. Some of the other lung cancer induced back pain symptoms include swelling in the face or neck, respiratory infections, hoarseness in the voice, and recurrent pneumonia. </p> 
       <p> Unfortunately, since back pain is a fairly common ailment, most people do not realize how serious it can be and therefore they disregard the problem. However, in case the back pain lasts for an extended period or is accompanied by other signs, it is important to consult a medical health care provider for an accurate diagnosis.</p>

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Causes of Back Pain</h2> 
       <p>We generally ignore back pain, and only seek medical attention when the pain becomes unbearable. In many cases, timely treatment would help to resolve the issue immediately. However, the prolonged period of neglect aggravates the condition to a point where extensive and aggressive treatment is necessary. Mild back pain that acts up occasionally is usually trivial and may simply be caused by muscle pulls, stiffness or muscle fatigue. But back pain that occurs with increasing frequency or greater severity is usually indicative of a more serious problem.</p>
       <p> What causes lower back pain or upper and middle back pain? Some of the most common causes for back pain, especially lower back pain could include: </p>
       <ul> 
        <li> Strains </li> 
        <li> Ruptured discs or bulging discs </li> 
        <li> Sciatica </li> 
        <li> Skeletal irregularities </li> 
        <li> Arthritis </li> 
        <li> Osteoporosis </li> 
        <li> Spinal infections </li> 
        <li> Cancer in the spine </li> 
       </ul>
       <p> Pain in different parts of the lower back could be the result of different factors. Hernia, irritable bowel syndrome, muscle strains, kidney diseases, injuries, improper posture and sciatica or nerve problems can result in lower right side back pain. Lower right side back pain causes difficulty in carrying out simple everyday chores and can become a serious health issue if it is ignored. Lower left back pain causes include muscle problems, herniated discs, wear and tear related to aging and lifting heavy objects.</p>
       <p> Most of the common middle back pain causes overlap with the causes of lower back pain. However, many people suffer from pain in the middle back because of poor postures maintained when seated or sleeping. People prone to muscle cramps or spasms are also more likely to suffer from pain in the middle back. </p>
       <p> Kidney infections or kidney stones can result in intense kidney pain along with other symptoms. Kidney pain causes immense discomfort as it manifests as a stabbing pain in the lower back.</p>
