       <p>Nephritis can be described as a serious inflammation, which affects either one or both of your kidneys. This condition is also referred to as kidney nephritis, tubointerstitial nephritis or interstitial nephritis. There are different types of nephritis that have been known to affect humans. Given below are some of the most common nephritis types:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li> Acute nephritis </li> 
        <li> Chronic nephritis</li> 
        <li> Glomerulonephritis</li> 
        <li> Primary glomerulonephritis</li> 
        <li> Autoimmune nephritis</li> 
        <li> Lupus nephritis</li> 
        <li> Pyelonephritis</li> 
        <li> Interstitial nephritis</li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>Though any of these types of nephritis can affect a person, some of the most common types include acute nephritis and chronic nephritis. The causes for each of these conditions may also vary. There are several factors that could cause you to suffer from this condition. At times, this problem could be the result of an infection, such as a bacterial infection; in many instances, nephritis can also occur because excess exposure to toxins of any sort. However, one of the most common factors that lead to this disease is the presence of an autoimmune disease, which affects the major organs in the body.</p> 
       <p>Not a lot of people are aware of how serious nephritis can be or how common it is. Data shows that this condition is the ninth highest cause of death in humans, across the world. It is absolutely essential to seek medical help and assistance in all cases of nephritis. If left untreated, this condition worsens rapidly. Therefore, as soon as any of the symptoms of nephritis are evident, it is important for you to visit a doctor. You may need to undergo a blood test, a urine test or x-rays for an accurate diagnosis.</p> 
       <p>There are many individuals who do not have any of the symptoms that are normally associated with nephritis; they only realize that they are suffering from this condition, when they undergo a routine checkup.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Symptoms of Nephritis</h2>
       <h2></h2> 
       <p>In case you are suffering from nephritis disease, you kidneys could get affected to such an extent that they may not be able to function in the right manner. Functions like getting rid of the water from the body may also be affected adversely. Therefore, one of the first symptoms for nephritis is edema or swelling due to water retention. While the swelling could be seen in many parts, it is more common in the hands, legs, feet and ankles. Contrary to what many people believe, pain is rarely one of the symptoms for nephritis. However, there are other signs and symptoms that may be evident because of this disease. Given below are some of the other common symptoms for nephritis:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li> An increase or decrease in the frequency of urination or the amount of urine passed each time</li> 
        <li> Breathing problems </li> 
        <li> Changes in the color of urine, as it appears frothy or darker</li> 
        <li> Extreme fatigue, accompanied by weakness</li> 
        <li> Presence of blood in the urine </li> 
       </ul> 
       <p>In case of acute nephritis, which is more common in children than in adults, the inflammation is rather sudden. Therefore, symptoms like edema and the retention or urine may not necessarily be present. However, in such cases, even though urine is being passed in normal quantities, the amount of waste that is eliminated from the body may be a lot less, in comparison.</p> 
       <p>In fact, it has been seen that nephritis patients are more likely to pass higher amounts of urine during the night. Sometimes, you may pass urine so often, because of nephritis that your thirst may also increase. As the condition progresses, the symptoms noticed may also become severe, as they include increase in blood pressure, severe headaches, itchiness, nausea and vomiting. At times, the patient may also see traces of blood while vomiting. </p> 
       <p>There are many patients who seek medical attention only when these symptoms crop up.</p>

       <h2>Causes of Nephritis</h2> 
       <p>There are many different factors that have been known to trigger off kidney nephritis disease. Given below are some of the most common causes for nephritis:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li> Autoimmune Disorders: Under normal circumstances, your immune system plays the important role of identifying the different parts of your body and distinguishing them from any invaders that may try to enter. Your immune system also then tries to attack the invaders, so that the body can get rid of them. However, some factors can cause your immune system to attack normal parts of the body, instead of the invaders. There are several organs in the human body that can be affected by such autoimmune disorders, the kidney being one of them. There are numerous kidney diseases that can occur as a result of immune system problems and nephritis is one of them. </li> 
        <li> Bacteria: One of the most common causes of infections and inflammation in children as well as adults is the streptococcus bacteria </li> 
        <li> Medication: It has been seen that those who have been taking certain medication for a long period of time may be more prone to nephritis, as compared to the others. The use of specific medicines is one of the causes of nephritis in older people. </li> 
        <li> Heredity Factors: Nephritis disease has been known to run in the members of a family. Therefore, you are at a much higher risk of developing this condition, if any of your parents or siblings has been diagnosed with it, at some point. </li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Remedies for Nephritis</h2> 
       <p>Fortunately, it is possible to cure nephritis, using a variety of treatment options. In most cases, the condition is treated aggressively, using steroids and antibiotics. However, not everyone reacts to nephritis treatment in the exact same manner. Some of the factors that determine the success of nephritis treatment include your age, overall health, the severity of the condition and the extent of damage caused to your kidneys. In case you happen to respond to the treatment positively, then the symptoms will disappear completely. However, in case the damage to the kidneys is quite severe, then the recovery may only be partial. It is also possible to treat nephritis from home, using a combination of simple and natural remedies or incorporating a few healthy lifestyle changes.</p> 
       <p>It is important that a person suffering from nephritis should not exert himself while engaging in any physical activity. However, there are many exercises that are quite mild and gentle and while they allow you to enjoy all the benefits that have been associated with exercising, they do not put too much strain on your body. Start by walking at least three kilometers once a day and increase the amount you walk gradually. Try to get as much fresh air as possible, as it has an excellent effect on your overall health. You could walk in a park or an open area that is not polluted. In case youd like to engage in other aerobic exercises, it is best to get an approval from a doctor first. Also make sure that you get the amount of rest required by your body, on a daily basis.</p> 
       <p>If you have the habits of drinking alcohol or smoking, you need to give up on these practices immediately. Both drinking and smoking can have an adverse effect on all the organs of your body, including the kidneys.</p> 
       <p>There are many other dietary changes that should be incorporated, in order to speed up the healing process. Unfortunately, in case the nephritis caused by conditions such as lupus or HIV, then it may not really be curable.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Diet for Nephritis</h2> 
       <p>Your regular daily diet plays a very important role in your overall health and wellbeing. There are several foods that can help you recover from nephritis at a faster pace and at the same time, there are a few foods that aggravate the condition. Given below are some dietary tips for nephritis:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li> Drink fresh coconut water on a regular basis, preferably every day </li> 
        <li> Consume a high amount of avocadoes, as it helps the problem to a great extent. You can choose to have avocado soup, salad or guacamole, based on your tastes and preferences. </li> 
        <li> Have plenty of fresh vegetable juice, which is completely devoid of any sugar, artificial sweeteners or preservatives. Carrot juice, to which a teaspoon of honey has been added is especially beneficial</li> 
        <li> Follow an all fruit diet for around 4 to days and consume high amounts of apples, oranges, pears, grapes, peaches, bananas and pineapples </li> 
        <li> Increase your intake of water and make sure that you consume no less than 8 to 10 glasses a day, as it flushes the toxins out of your body. </li> 
        <li> Avoid foods that contain high amounts of oxalic acid, which is found in spinach, rhubarb, chocolate or other products made from cocoa. </li> 
        <li> Cut down on your intake of salt, which means that you need to stay away from processed meat, junk food and instant foods. </li> 
        <li> Eliminate fried food from your diet completely for a while, at least till you recover from this condition. </li>
       </ul>
