       <p>Jaundice is a symptom that can develop as part of various diseases. It refers to the yellowish discoloration of the skin and whites of the eyes. This happens when levels of the chemical bilirubin increase in the bloodstream. Mild elevation in bilirubin levels causes the skin to become yellow. When bilirubin levels are very high, the skin takes on a brown or yellow hue. Jaundice can be categorized into three main types, hepatocellular, hemolytic and obstructive jaundice. Hepatocellular jaundice occurs when injury or disease affects the liver. Hemolytic jaundice develops when the breakdown of red blood cells takes place at an accelerated pace. Obstructive jaundice is the result of a blockage in the tubes that transport bile between the liver, gallbladder and small intestines. Such an obstruction does not allow the bilirubin to leave the liver and this leads to jaundice.</p>

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Symptoms of Jaundice</h2> 
       <p>The most prominent of all jaundice symptoms is the yellowish staining of the skin and whites of the eyes. This discoloration first becomes discernible in the facial region and then spreads across the body. Some of the other common symptoms of jaundice include:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>Tiredness</li> 
        <li>Itching</li> 
        <li>Appetite loss</li> 
        <li>Weight loss</li> 
        <li>Abdominal discomfort, in case there is obstruction of the bile duct</li> 
        <li>Nausea</li> 
        <li>Vomiting</li> 
        <li>Lethargy</li> 
        <li>Pale colored stools</li> 
        <li>Fever</li> 
        <li>Dark yellow urine</li> 
        <li>Bitter taste in the mouth</li>
       </ul> 
       <p>Jaundice commonly develops in babies, usually soon after birth. Infants affected with jaundice may have yellowing of the skin, but this may be difficult to identify since the skin tone of babies is different from adults. Jaundice tests are usually done 36 hours after birth. One can also tell if a baby has jaundice by gently pressing the infant's forehead. If the skin appears yellow in the area that was pressed, it is possible that the baby has jaundice. In case other symptoms such as persistent crying, listlessness and poor feeding are present, it is important for the child to receive medical care.</p>

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Causes of Jaundice</h2> 
       <p>Jaundice mainly occurs when an underlying condition affects the bilirubin levels in the blood. In some cases, the liver is unable to remove bilirubin while in other cases; bilirubin may accumulate in the tissues. Some of the underlying disorders that may result in jaundice include:</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li><strong>Liver Inflammation:</strong> When the liver becomes inflamed, it may be unable to dispose of bilirubin. </li> 
        <li><strong>Bile duct Inflammation:</strong> The bile duct is the tube through which bile passes. Acute inflammation of the bile duct can impede the manner in which bilirubin is secreted and removed.</li> 
        <li><strong>Bile Duct Obstruction:</strong> The liver is unable to remove bilirubin properly when there are blockages in the bile duct.</li> 
        <li><strong>Hemolytic Anemia:</strong> Accelerated breakdown of the red blood cells leads to increased bilirubin production</li> 
        <li><strong>Gilbert's Syndrome:</strong> This is a condition that affects the functioning of enzymes, resulting in improper excretion of bile. Gilbert's syndrome is an inherited disorder.</li> 
        <li><strong>Cholestasis:</strong> In this condition, the passage of bile is affected, causing it to accumulate in the liver.</li> 
        <p>There are also some rare disorders that can lead to jaundice. These include:</p> 
        <li><strong>Crigler-Najjar Syndrome:</strong> This is a genetic condition that affects certain enzymes that are involved in the processing of bilirubin</li> 
        <li><strong>Dubin-Johnson Syndrome:</strong> Another inherited disorder that disrupts the removal of bilirubin from the liver cells</li> 
        <li><strong>Pseudojaundice:</strong>This condition occurs due to an increase in beta-carotene levels. It mostly occurs due to increased consumption of foods that contain the nutrient, beta-carotene. It is a harmless condition and is not associated with high bilirubin levels.</li>
       </ul>

       <h2>Remedies for Jaundice</h2> 
       <p>The treatment of jaundice usually begins after diagnosing the underlying cause. The treatment will then be aimed at resolving the specific cause. Jaundice that occurs due to anemia may be treated by elevating the iron levels in the blood through iron supplements or with the intake of foods rich in iron. Jaundice induced by hepatitis may be treated with anti-viral medications. Surgery may be required in cases where the condition develops as a result of blockages. In some cases, jaundice may even develop as a result of, as a side effect from certain medications. In such cases, the jaundice may be treated by altering the dosage or changing the medication.</p>
       <p>Medical treatment however is absolutely essential, not just for the treatment, but more importantly for an accurate diagnosis of the underlying cause, so as to facilitate appropriate treatment. Home care and lifestyle modifications are however an important aspect of treatment and the recuperation process. You can also try using other natural methods that are believed to help in the treatment of jaundice, but not all of these methods have been scientifically proven, so exercise caution.

        <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> Add some pepper and salt to fresh tomato juice and drink every morning. Lycopene from tomatoes can help to reduce damage to the liver and even facilitate recovery. </li> 
        <li><strong>Snake Gourd Leaves:</strong> Add some dry snake gourd leaves to boiling water. Then boil coriander seeds in water until it reduces to one third the amount. Combine both decoctions and drink thrice every day.</li> 
        <li><strong>Almonds:</strong> Soak 7 to 8 almond kernels in water and keep overnight. Peel the almonds, grind into a paste and consume. You can also consume almonds along with dried dates and cardamoms. The dates and cardamoms should also be soaked in water for the night.</li>

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Diet for Jaundice</h2> 
       <p>Proper diet and adequate rest is essential for recovery from jaundice. Here are some helpful dietary tips for those affected by jaundice:</p>
       <ul> 
        <li>A good intake of fluids helps to remove excess bilirubin from the body through the urine and stool. Make sure that you drink clean, uncontaminated water. Vegetable and fruit juices are also beneficial as they help to regulate the balance of electrolytes in the body. Avoid canned juices. Usually a liquid diet is recommended for the first 4 to 5 days. Alcohol should be avoided completely as it can seriously affect the liver.</li> 
        <li>Once the bilirubin levels start decreasing, light foods such as fruits, porridge and yogurt may be added to the diet. You can also consume vegetables such as spinach and carrots. Some amount of lean protein will help in recovery and hence you can also consume egg. It is advisable to divide your meals into smaller portions and eat them frequently during the day. Refrain from eating foods that are oily or spicy. Sugary foods, artificial sweeteners and caffeine should also be avoided.</li> 
        <li>As the bilirubin levels reduce to almost normal, you can add foods such as rice, lentil or fish to your diet. Ensure that no oil is used to cook foods. You can eat your fish either boiled or steamed. Avoid eating meat or poultry as it may be difficult to digest. </li> 
        <li>Once the symptoms have subsided and you have your doctor's approval, you can eat foods cooked in olive oil. But try to avoid eating foods rich in cholesterol and those which are hard to digest. The body needs time to regain its normal functioning.</li>
       </ul> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="suggestion"></a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Suggestion for Jaundice</h2> 
       <p>The best way to prevent jaundice in babies it to ensure that they are fed sufficiently. Babies that are breast-fed should get 8 to 12 feedings daily for the initial few days after birth. In case of babies that are formula-fed, one to two ounces given every couple of hours is recommended during the first week after birth.</p>

           <p>To get rid of jaundice in new born babies, breastfeed the baby every two hours or less to move the bowels and keep your baby under direct morning sunlight (between 8-10)for one hour everyday till jaundice vanishes.</p>

           <p>Breastfeed, breastfeed, breastfeed. The more you nurse, the more the baby needs to move his/her bowels This gets rid of the bilirubin. So breastfeed continuously. (May have to wake a sleepy baby...)</p>
