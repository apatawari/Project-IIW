       <p>Enema is known as easiest and one of the natural ways of getting your colon cleaned. It is one of the simplest remedy which would help you to wash away all your stomach problems. It is a procedure wherein a fluid is put into the rectum and colon via the anus to remove the toxins. A lubricant is massaged inside the anus and rectum to relax you when the nozzle or rectal tube is inserted. This liquid treatment is adhered to clear the bowel, induce better functioning of the bowel, to cleanse and provide therapeutic benefits.</p>

       <h2>Benefits of Enema Treatment</h2>
       <h3>Benefits of Enema</h3> 
       <p>Every enema treatment is different as it provides unique solution depending upon your level of problem. The usage of different enema solution can help cure many diseases. Some common benefits which enema provides are the removal of any content present in our colon which causes illness. It helps to remove heavy metals from intestinal walls. By the use of coffee, bile discharge is elevated. It is also a great remedy for common illnesses like headache. With the helps of tincture it can kill parasites. The herbal bowel cleaners help you with chronic constipation problem.</p> 
       <h3>Need for Enema Treatment</h3> 
       <p>For our body to work in a better manner, the smoothness of the bowel movement is very important. The constant dumping of junk food and many other reasons takes a toll on your body which leads to problems with colon. Other than quick excretion of the feces, enema helps to ward off many diseases which haunt our entire life. It is used when you have troubles like constipation, hemorrhoid, colitis and detoxification. If there is bowel blockage, enema is the best recommended solution. Enemas are useful for health reasons, but have been more popular for pleasurable reasons.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="remedy">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h2>Types of Enema</h2>
       <h3>Barium Enema or Lower Gastrointestinal examination</h3> 
       <p>This type of enema is used in clinics and hospitals during an X-ray examination of the large intestine. This test helps to diagnose diseases and other health problems related to the large intestine. The barium solution makes the intestine visible on an x-ray picture, letting you know whether your intestine is in a good or bad condition.</p> 
       <h3>Coffee Enema</h3> 
       <p>This type of enema helps in detoxification of the liver. The caffeine in coffee is directly absorbed into the system and enters the liver to detoxify it from the toxins. It causes the liver to produce more bile which is later flushed out from the small intestine. One should use regular ground coffee and not the instant coffee to make the enema solution.</p> 
       <h3>Yoghurt Enema</h3> 
       <p>Home made yoghurt is very good as it has live bacteria which helps in cleansing. Anyone suffering from inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, colon cancer, hemorrhoids and many more problems can use this enema.</p> 
       <h3>Lemon Juice Enema</h3> 
       <p>It is very useful in cleansing your colon from the feces by using 1/3 cup of lemon juice per quart. In comparison to other enemas, it may cause further cramping. So, if you are ready to face the music, go ahead and take this lemon juice enema treatment.</p> 
       <h3>Garlic Epsom Salt Enema</h3> 
       <p>For this you will need 3 cloves of chopped garlic in 2 quarts of water. Bring it to boil and later simmer it for 5 minutes and add 2 tbsp of Epsom salt. When warm use it as your enema solution.</p> 
       <h3>Epsom Salt Enema</h3> 
       <p>This type of enema is very useful for the colon. The Epsom salt present in the water increases the amount of water absorbed by the intestine and provides a laxative effect. This has been highly recommended as a cleanser.</p> 
       <h3>Salt Water Enema</h3> 
       <p>The presence of salt in the enema solution reduces the transfer of water into and out of the colon. This prevents accumulation of water in kidneys and bladder therefore cutting down on your trips to the bathroom during this enema treatment.</p> 
       <h3>Milk Enema</h3> 
       <p>This can be made by using 1 1/2 quart of warm water with 16 oz. of warm milk and 1 tbsp olive oil. To maintain a proper temperature you can heat the milk in a microwave. Pour the warm milk, olive oil and warm water in the enema bag. To make a milk and honey recipe you can add 1 tbsp of honey.</p> 
       <h3>Salt and Soda Enema</h3> 
       <p>To make this solution you would need 1 tbsp sea salt, 1 tbsp baking soda and 2 quarts of water. This works greatly to clear away the toxins present in your colon.</p> 
       <h3>Glycerin and Mineral Oil Enema</h3> 
       <p>This cleansing agent requires 1 1/2 quart of warm water, 2 tbsp of salt, 2 tbsp of mineral oil and 2 tbsp of glycerin. This solution does wonders to your colon by cleansing it. The salt water maintains the absorption to a minimum and the oil and glycerin are useful for cleaning.</p> 
       <h3>Vinegar Enema</h3> You can use 2 tbsp white vinegar with 2 quarts of warm water. Similarly you can have wheat grass enema and mineral oil enema. ﻿

           <p>I really don't like the taste of green tea but love the benefits so I have an enema practically every day using green tea. Boil 1.5 litres of water (take off the the heat as soon as it starts to boil) and place 3-4 table spoons of organic green tea leaves in the water. Leave to cool to room temp and use. I sometimes combine this with other recipes such as milk thistle tincture or olive oil. My skin glows after I have done this and I feel fantasitic and rejuvenated. </p>

           <p>In the evening put in a glass or porcelain bowl: 2 spoons of flax seeds and 2 spoons of silver birch leaves in 16.9 oz. (500ml) of water. Let it macerate at room temperature from evening until the morning; filter. Put the content aside and take the plant and boil it for 2 minutes in another 16.9 oz. (500ml) of water; filter. In the end mix the solution extract obtained by macerating and the solution obtained by boiling. Put the solution in the enema bag, lay down on one side, keep the tank about 19.69in (50cm) higher than the nozzle level and let the solution gradually enter your colon (do not force if you feel a discomfort). After introducing the whole amount of (33.81 oz) solution, retain it for 10-15 minutes. Remain in the sleeping position and turn from one side to another. Go to the toilet and expel the enema. Do this enema every morning for 10 days in a row (once in 6 months). This is a great way to cleanse your body and boost your immune system. <br /></p>
