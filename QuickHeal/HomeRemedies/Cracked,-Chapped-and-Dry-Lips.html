When the lips become too dry, tiny tears may appear on the surface and this can lead to bleeding and considerable discomfort. Chapped lips are rarely a serious problem and mainly develop during the cold winter months, and due to wind exposure or sunburn. Those who have a habit of constantly licking the lips may also develop chapped lips. Breathing through the mouth can also cause your lips to become dry. In some cases, certain mild health conditions such as a common cold, nutritional deficiencies, allergies and dehydration may cause the lips to become dry and cracked. It is very easy to care for chapped and dry lips and theres a lot that you can do to reduce the severity of the problem, such as increasing water intake, avoiding cold or sun exposure and using simple home remedies.

           <p>Using anything containing petroleum jelly such as carmex or vaseline continuously will only dry your lips out more and make them even worse. I found out the hard way. My lips have been severly chapped for the last month due to cold weather. I stopped using carmex 2 DAYS AGO and my lips have improved more than they have in the past month!! </p>

           <p> Most chapped lips are actually because the saliva has digestive enzymes that &quot;eat&quot; the skin on the lips. Then bacteria takes over, causing the itching and irritation. I've found that balms actually extend chapped lips conditions. The best cure I've found is applying hydrogen peroxide to the lips. Sometimes the lips are cured and silky smooth the next morning. </p>

           <p>Just apply milk cream to your lips at bedtime for atleast 15 mins, and then wash it off. This will give a soothing effect, prevent cracks on the lips. If you want to add color to your lips, add a small drop of turmeric to the cream. The colour of lips will be maintained.</p>
