       <p>Chest congestion is a rather common problem, as the symptom or condition may be associated with a variety of other health conditions and diseases. This could include common ailments such as a common cold or most other respiratory infections, as well as with conditions like heart disease. </p>
       <p><strong>So What Exactly is Chest Congestion?</strong> Chest congestion refers to a feeling of tightness or pressure and heaviness in the chest. Breathing may be labored as a result of this tightness and pressure, and chest congestion could in fact imply difficulty breathing and a restriction in the air flow. Congestion literally means obstruction to movement and in the context of chest congestion it refers to obstruction to the flow of oxygen into the lungs. Chest congestion symptoms are therefore mostly indicative of some underlying health condition and it would be wise to seek a prompt medical diagnosis, as many of the possible causes could prove life threatening if neglected.</p>
       <p> Although chest congestion does not necessarily involve difficulty breathing, this is most often the case, and it is usually caused by a buildup of mucus or some fluid in or around the lungs. Chest congestion is an extremely uncomfortable and often painful condition in which the lungs fill up with excess of mucus and other fluids. Chest congestion is often accompanied with cough which is a natural method through which the body attempts to get rid of accumulated phlegm.</p>
       <p> Sometimes, if a person has very severe congestion in the chest, the breathing mechanism actually becomes audible. The sound of a person struggling to breathe during chest congestion is much like a crackling noise. The person may have labored breathing, persistent cough and sometimes chest pain too.</p>

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Symptoms of Chest Congestion</h2> 
       <p>The symptoms of chest congestion are easily identifiable. Shortness of breath, labored breathing, coughing, chest pain, dizziness, runny nose, wheezing, discomfort, blood in cough, and loud noises while breathing are all common symptoms of chest congestion. However, more often than not, chest congestion is itself a symptom that is accompanied by several other symptoms. If the chest congestion is caused by a flu, it may be accompanied by fever, chills, body aches and malaise. The symptoms of chest congestion therefore depend to a great extent, on the cause. These symptoms may appear in isolation or sometimes, all of them could also occur together.</p>
       <p> Diagnosing the condition at home however is not really an option, but there are plenty of natural remedies for chest congestion that could offer considerable chest congestion relief. There is no home cure for chest congestion however, and any natural remedy for chest congestion will simply help to relieve chest congestion. Natural remedies are not an alternative to medical treatment. While minor conditions like a cold chest congestion or chest congestion from a cough may be treated quite effectively at home, the problem could in some cases be caused by a life threatening condition such as lung cancer. In such a scenario, prompt detection could make a huge difference to the final outcome of treatment.</p>
       <p> Your doctor will be able to make an accurate diagnosis, and depending on the other symptoms that are present you may be required to go in for certain tests to ascertain the cause. Some tests that may be required depending on the presence of other symptoms could include blood tests for measurement of blood oxygen saturation or arterial blood gases, chest x-rays or CT scans, pulmonary function tests, and exercise testing, among others.</p>

       <h2>Causes of Chest Congestion</h2> 
       <p>Chest congestion is not always a condition in itself, but is usually a symptom of some other health condition. Very often, infections of the lower respiratory tract cause chest congestion to develop, and the individual may notice such symptoms, with breathing difficulty and chest pain. Allergic reactions, like infections, can also cause an inflammation of the respiratory tract, as is the case in asthma. The inflammation is therefore an immune system response to the presence of a bacterial, viral, fungal or parasitic infection, or due to the presence of an allergen. When there is any inflammation of the airways, mucus tends to accumulate in the region, being one of the main chest congestion causes.</p>
       <p> There are several causes of chest congestion, of which, common cold is the most common. However, chest congestion is often a symptom of a more sinister underlying disease. Chest congestion could be a sign of asthma, which is a chronic disease. It could also be caused due to bronchitis or pneumonia. Some of the other disorders associated with chest congestion are the flu, airborne allergies, gastroesophageal reflux, pulmonary edema, croup, heart failure, pneumonia, lung cancer, and cystic fibrosis.</p>
