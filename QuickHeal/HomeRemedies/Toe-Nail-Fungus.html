       <p>Paranoychia or onychomycosis are most often seen in toenail fungus infections. Although a mild infection in the early stages may cause little to no discomfort, with the only visible symptoms being toenail discoloration, black or thick toenails and crumbling of the nails it is absolutely essential for you to begin toenail fungus treatment immediately. The treatment of toenail fungus with tea tree oil or toenail fungus home remedies can help significantly in these early stages but these home remedies are no substitute for medical treatment as the results vary greatly. For an effective toenail fungus cure it would be best to employ a combination of medical treatments and toenail fungus home remedies.</p>
       <p> <img src="/health-images/toenail-discoloration-picture.jpg" title="Toenail Fungus Treatment, Home Remedies, Cures" alt="Toenail Fungus Picture" /></p>
       <p> Fungal infections are common on both fingernails and toenails. Toenail fungus also known as onychomycosis is caused by a group of fungus called dermatophytes. These fungus are harmful because as they grow they feed on the keratin that makes up the surface of the toe nail. The two fingers that are more likely to be affected are the big toe and the little toe. The big toe and the little toe are in fact the most susceptible to paronychia, which is an infection of the soft tissue around the nail. Toenail fungus causes disfiguration and discoloration of the nails. It is a contagious disease and some times it may be hereditary. Paronychia and onycholysis are common toenail problems and may require medical assistance if they have been neglected. </p>
       <p> <img src="/health-images/toenail-fungus-picture.jpg" title="Ingrown Toenail Infection" alt="Toenail Fungus Symptoms" /></p>
       <p>Some of the popular treatments involve treating the condition with black toenail fungus home remedies like bleach and hydrogen peroxide. The use of bleach for toenail fungus is quite popular as a foot fungus remedy. The use of baking soda for toenail fungus or fingernail fungus and skin fungus is also very popular and there are plenty of nail fungus baking soda remedies. The best home remedies for toenail fungus treatment are also not a sure bet however as there are no instant or fast home remedies for toenail fungus. If for some reason you cannot seek medical attention and toenail fungus home treatments are necessary then it would be best to try nail fungus treatment with over the counter nail fungus medications and applications. </p>
       <p> If you have done a search and browsed through pictures of nail fungus you will probably have noticed that there are various types of nail fungus and nail disorders, making nail care so important. Fungal infections are not just limited to the skin however and a toe fungus or cuticle fungus could also leave you at an increased risk of developing other fungal infections like skin fungus, finger fungus, or scalp fungus.</p>

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Symptoms of Toe Nail Fungus</h2> 
       <p>There are plenty of images and pictures of toenail fungus available on the internet, and looking through these toenail fungus pictures should give you some idea of the appearance of the condition.</p>
       <p>Symptoms of toenail fungus are quite obvious. The affected nail will get yellow or brown in colour. It may become so thick and overgrown that it may be painful to wear shoes. Foul-smelling debris may get accumulated under the nail. The signs of toenail fungus are actually not hard to recognize as the foul odor emanating from the toenails is something that cannot be ignored. The nail may crumble and eventually fall off. Toenail discoloration is not uncommon either. Streaks or spots can be seen down the side of the nails of the affected person. Thick toenails or black toenails may not be your typical toenail fungus symptoms, but could at times be indicative of a paronychia or toenail fungus infections. Ingrown toenails, although not necessarily symptomatic of toenail fungus, should also be treated promptly as there are plenty of effective and inexpensive ingrown toenail remedies. An infected ingrown toenail can become a very serious problem as it may require surgery if it is neglected. You can always ask your doctor for information on how to get rid of an ingrown toenail. </p>
       <p>The thickening and discoloration of nails is usually caused by toenail fungus that occurs when a microscopic fungus either enters a toenail or fingernail. Neglecting the condition poses the risk of an ingrown toenail infection, as well as other conditions like paronychia, onychomycosis, and onycholysis among others. Toenail fungus treatment helps to control the infection and prevents further damage to the toenail. This also shortens the recovery period. Home remedies for toenail fungus get rid of the fungus causing the infection, without damaging the toenail.</p>

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Causes of Toe Nail Fungus</h2> 
       <p>A lack of personal hygiene can be another major contributing factor, as wearing socks and shoes for prolonged periods creates the perfect environment for fungal growth - a moist and warm habitat. Sharing footwear and other personal items also poses a significant risk. There are various factors that could contribute to or aggravate the condition and these include imbalances in the pH levels, a lack of personal hygiene  sharing footwear, walking bare footed in public pools, baths or gyms, not drying off the feet thoroughly after bathing or exercise, and decreased immunity. Staying in sweaty shoes and socks for prolonged periods or failing to change your socks frequently enough also increases the risk of a toenail fungus infection as fungi are known to thrive in moist and warm conditions.</p> 
       <ul> 
        <li>You may get affected by the toenail fungus in damp areas such as public gyms, shower stalls or swimming pools.</li> 
        <li>Toe nail fungus can spread from one toe to another or to other body parts.</li> 
        <li>Athletes and people who give trauma to their toe by wear tight-fitting shoes or tight hosiery are at great risk of toe nail fungus.</li> 
        <li>Other reasons may be abnormal pH level of the skin, not drying off the feet thoroughly after bathing or exercise, and decreased immunity.</li>

       <h2>Remedies for Toe Nail Fungus</h2>
       <h3>Toe Nail Fungus Remedy using Tea Tree Oil</h3> 
       <p>Tea tree oil is a potent natural antiseptic and fungicide that will help fight your fungus. Apply undiluted tea tree oil with olive oil to the affected toe nail. Alternatively you can put few drops of tea tree oil on toenails and rub it thoroughly every day. Onychomycosis treatment with tea tree oil is often recommended for mild to moderate cases of Onychomycosis. It is recommended that you mix equal quantities of olive oil, thyme oil, and tea tree oil and apply this blend of oil to the affected nail. Allow it to remain on for 10 -15 minutes and then use a toothbrush to gently scrub the affected nail. This ensures that the oil covers the nail completely and also gets under the nails. Scrubbing the affected nail gently also helps to slough off the uppermost layer of the nail which generally contains most of the fungus. In order to get rid of toenail fungus completely, you will need to continue using tea tree oil for a few weeks after the infection has cleared. This is because there may still be remnants of the fungus which may be embedded deep within the nail or the nail bed. In order to make a definite diagnosis of Onychomycosis, the doctor or podiatrist may recommend a potassium hydroxide smear test. The doctor may also suggest creams containing terbinafine if the infection is severe.</p> 
       <h3>Using Listerine Mouthwash</h3> 
       <p>Soak your toes in Listerine mouthwash. The powerful antiseptic leaves your toe nails looking healthy. Mouthwash contains several compounds and alcohols like salicylate thymol and euchalyptol which combine to form a strong toenail fungus treatment. Toenail fungus home remedies generally require a mixture of mouthwash and a strong natural acid like apple cider vinegar or undiluted lemon juice. This is done to increase the effectiveness of the treatment as acid retards the growth of fungus and prevents it from spreading. You can pour a sufficient amount of this mouthwash and an equal amount of vinegar into a tub and soak your feet in it for 20 minutes or so. This needs to be done at least once a day and is an effective home remedy for toenail fungus. However, large amounts of vinegar and mouthwash are necessary and so you can just mix small amounts of the liquid and paint your nails with it. If the infection has already spread, you can soak a thick wad of cotton in this liquid and place it over the affected toe. You should then wrap it up with a small bandage to keep the cotton wad in place. Allow this to remain on for about 45 minutes and then scrub your toe gently with a small amount of the solution. You would need to do this on a daily basis to see long lasting results. In most cases, it takes about a week to experience a noticeable improvement and with continued usage, your nails will soon be healthy and free of infection. When you treat toenail fungus, it is important to keep in mind that after any and all toenail fungus treatments, it is essential that the affected toe is dried thoroughly as excessive moisture would cause the infection to spread. This is a very effective paronychia treatment as it helps to prevent the formation of pus which is very common with this type of nail infection.</p> 
       <h3>Curing Toe Nail Fungus using Warm Water and Natural Apple Cider Vinegar</h3> 
       <p>Soak your toenails for 15 - 20 minutes in basin full of warm water and natural apple cider vinegar mixed in equal proportion. When done, dry your toenails thoroughly. Use a hair dryer on warm setting to absorb all the moisture in and around the toes. Apple cider vinegar is a mild acid and prevents toenail fungus from spreading. It is very effective as a complementary treatment but it may not be as effective as the main method of treatment. Paronychia often causes scaling and the fungus then thrives under the layers of dead skin. Exfoliation is therefore an extremely important aspect of Paronychia treatment. When exfoliating the affected area, make sure that you do not apply excessive pressure as this would result in abrasions and pain. You can make your own anti-fungal exfoliating scrub by mixing coarsely ground rice flour with a few spoons of apple cider vinegar. Apply this paste over the affected nail and the surrounding area and then gently rub it into the nail and skin. You can use a cotton swab to ensure that your entire nail is well scrubbed. If your skin is cut or sore, avoid massaging your skin and instead concentrate only on your toenail. This exfoliating scrub will help to get rid of dead skin and nail cells and will also help to keep your skin soft and prevent cracking. You can rinse your feet well and then dry them with a soft towel. Mix equal amounts of lemon juice and olive oil and massage this into your feet. The olive oil will help to soften your skin while the lemon juice will help to control the fungal infection.</p> 
       <h3>Tea Tree Oil and Lavender Oil</h3> 
       <p>Put equal amount of tea tree oil and lavender oil on a cotton ball or swab. Dab it under the top edge of the toe nail and surrounding area 2 or 3 times a day. Tea tree oil is natural antibiotic and lavender will help fight the infection and prevent skin irritation, as it has antiseptic properties. This combination of oils is often used to treat paronychia and onychomycosis as they are both very potent and can help to treat even severe cases. It is best to warm these oils before using them as this increases the amount of oil that is absorbed by the skin. Tea tree oil and lavender oil are essential oils and contain several volatile compounds. It is therefore, important to dilute them in a carrier oil such as olive oil before you apply them to your skin. You can make your own anti fungal oil by mixing equal amounts of tea tree oil, lavender oil, and a carrier oil. Before you go to sleep, make sure that you apply this oil to your affected toenails. You can also put on a pair of thick woolen socks as this will help to trap your body heat and this in turn will increase the effectiveness of this remedy. It is important to use this treatment on a daily basis, particularly if you have neglected this problem for a while and allowed it to worsen.</p> 
       <h3>Using Oregano and Olive oil</h3> 
       <p>Blend 2 drops of Oregano essential oil with a tsp of olive oil. Apply this mixture on the affected area daily for NOT more than three weeks. Oregano essential oil has antiseptic, antibacterial, antiparasitical, antiviral, analgesic and antifungal properties</p> 
       <h3>AHA Creams</h3> 
       <p>Lather AHA (Alpha Hydroxy Acid) creams on to your feet before going to bed. This will flush the rough scaly skin from your feet that is more prone to growing fungus</p> 
       <h3>Laser Treatment for Toenail Fungus</h3> 
       <p>If youve tried most conventional or traditional methods of treatment and found them to be ineffective, you would then still be seeking methods on how to get rid of toenail fungus. Of all the so called toenail fungus cures, laser treatment is what seems to be the most promising. Toenail fungus laser treatment is the latest development in the realm of toenail fungus removal and most studies indicate that this is a viable option for those wishing to get rid of toenail fungus infections. Laser treatment for toenail fungus involves the use of a laser light to destroy the fungus in the nail bed itself. One of the types of laser treatment that is being used is the Noveon-type laser, which has been found to be quite effective as a cure for toenail fungus. This kind of laser treatment has already been used in the past as treatment for some types of cataract surgery and has been found to be very effective and painless. </p>
       <p> The PinPointe FootLaser system is another method of laser treatment for toenail fungus, but there is still inadequate info about these forms of treatment. The Pinpointe laser treatment method does have certain drawbacks that stem from its method of removal itself, as is uses high UV radiation to destroy the toenail fungus. The implications from this treatment are that despite a potentially effective cure for toenail fungus the Pinpointe toenail fungus laser treatment could also cause burns to surrounding tissue. The advantages of laser toenail fungus removal treatments in general are that they are swift and effective, with each treatment session just taking around 20 minutes, with around 3 sessions in all.</p>
       <p>Home remedies for nail fungus may not offer any sure cures for toenail fungus, but they do remain popular because of the convenience they offer and mainly because of the high costs of health care. While you may find plenty of toenail fungus home remedies blogs that promise quick solutions and effective cures most of them are not very honest. Home remedies for discolored toenails and fungal infections can have varied effects among different individuals and in most cases are ineffective. Even the best treatments would not work instantly and so there would be no way of knowing the effectiveness of the treatment for a while. If the remedies you use do prove to be ineffective which they generally do, you would have wasted a great deal of time, enabling the infection to grow even stronger. Even plausible home remedies for toenail fungus like bleach or vinegar for toenail fungus and toenail fungus vicks remedies are ineffective in most cases however because its impossible for most of these solutions to get to the fungus under toenails.</p>
       <p> Nail fungus laser treatment is believed to be the most effective and promising treatment option, but this can unfortunately be quite expensive.</p>

        <a id="diet">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Diet for Toe Nail Fungus</h2> 
       <p>Diet plays a very vital role in curing any ailment. People suffering from toe nail fungus should include more probiotics - good bacteria, in their diet. This will help your body to get rid of the fungus. Yogurt and kefir are good sources of probiotics. Reduce intake of refined carbs like sugar, dairy products and vinegar. Olive leaf extract is an excellent internal anti-fungal agent. The consumption of a balanced and healthy diet should be emphasized above all. Since toenail fungus doesnt really have any specific dietary causes, your diet doesnt really offer a toenail fungus cure, but it can significantly boost the effectiveness of treatment for toenail fungus, as it strengthens your immunity and minimizes susceptibility to infection.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="suggestion"></a>
       </div> 
       <h2>Suggestion for Toe Nail Fungus</h2>
       <h3>Wash your Feet after Visiting Public Places like Swimming Pools</h3> 
       <p>The fungus thrives in warm moist areas like spas, swimming pools, showers or locker rooms. If you step on a warm puddle or floor, you can pick up the infection. After using such public places, it is ideal to wash your feet thoroughly and dry them well. Preventive treatment is the most essential safeguard against toenail fungus as a toenail fungus remedy can take many weeks, or even months, to show results. Do keep in mind that in case of infection prompt treatment is essential. Treating toenail fungus infections carelessly will only result in an infection that is a lot more persistent and requiring lengthier treatment and stronger toenail fungus medications.</p> 
       <h3>Wear Cotton Socks</h3> 
       <p>Wear cotton socks to absorb moisture from the feet that happens from sweating. Our feet tend to get moist and sweaty due to excessive perspiration when you wear closed footwear for extended periods. If you dont have the option of wearing open footwear or of airing out your feet periodically, then make it a point to wear cotton socks at the very least, as they absorb most of the moisture.</p> 
       <h3>Dry Your Feet</h3> 
       <p>If your socks are damp, take them off and dry your feet before wearing a fresh pair of dry socks.</p> 
       <h3>Do Not Share Linen with Affected People</h3> 
       <p>Avoid sharing towels, washcloths, shoes or any other personal items of those people who have already contracted this disease. This is a matter of personal hygiene, and failing to follow such basic self care practices drastically increases exposure to onychomycosis infections.</p> 
       <h3>Trim Nails and Avoid Nail Polish</h3> 
       <p>Keep your nails cut short, and don't use nail polish. Trim your toenails regularly. Trim them into a straight line and then smooth the edges with a nail file.</p> ﻿

           <p>I tried most of the remedies mentioned with little success. Then per chance someone said try &quot;Mentholatum&quot;. It seems to kill the fungus, and my nails are getting better.</p>

           <p>For a very long time ... I had been doing everything in my power to remove fungus from three of my toes... finally, finally, finally, I found out how to do it... it does take some elbow greasing ... however it WORKS!!! Yeppie, it WORKS! <br />1.) Purchase Vinegar, Hydrogen Peroxide, Baking Soda, if you can find it.. (Detol - was only able to find this product where there is a huge population of Caribbean nationals... i.e. Miami)<br />2.) Mix the concoction together.<br />3.) Use a rough surface emery board or filer and file the outside of each toe... THOROUGHLY!!! Be COMPREHENSIVE!<br />4.) Take a cotton ball wet it with alcohol. Squeeze the alcohol out. <br />5.) Pour copious quantities on cotton ball. <br />6.) Apply to all toes... ALL even those NOT infected! <br />7.) Repeat this procedure at least with three (3) heavy sweeps <br />8.) Allow toes to dry for about five (5) minutes then <br />9.) Generously apply VICKS vapor rub heavily... continue to rub in until disappear... apply in between toes as well (no harm done) If you do this procedure at least twice (2x) per day... within 72 hours you will ALREADY begin to see a difference. This works on fingernails as well. YES, it does WORK!!! Remember keep filing the outside of your toes and use sterilized with alcohol toe and fingernail clippers and get RID of ALL the bad stuff... old spoilt nail... and you will have GORGEOUS toes and fingers.<br /><br /></p>

           <p>I wash my feet with anti-bacterial soap and dry them completely. I then wipe the entire nail with bleach on a q-tip. After that has dried I add a few drops of tea tree oil. After that has dried I coat with vapor rub. I do this 2x's a day.I also let me feet breathe whenever I can. So far its been a week and My nails are almost clear. Its worth a try.</p>

           <p>I applied 91% Isopropyl Alcohol. I rubbed it in where the nail and skin meet and under the nail as best I could. It took several days to see any results but, as the nails grew out they were the normal pinkish color nails are supposed to have and not the yellow color that the nails were. I applied the alcohol first thing in the morning and the last thing at night. As an experiment I stopped using the alcohol on one of the nails and the fungus started to spread out on that nail. From that point on, I never missed a treatment. I have had the fungus on each of my big toe nails for years and had not previously tried any remedy. Each of the nails were yellow and thick. This remedy is easy and very cost effective.</p>
