       <p>Snoring occurs when there is a vibration of your soft palate (the back part of the roof of your mouth). A number of factors cause this. The muscles supporting the opening of the upper airway in the back of the throat relax during sleep. Extra tissue in the palate and uvula, the fleshy piece between the tonsils-vibrates with each breath, and these vibrations actually cause the sound of snoring. In some people, the airway has a tendency to close at any point. Narrowing of the airway will cause turbulence and the noises of snoring.</p>

       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Symptoms of Snoring</h2> 
       <p>Low to high pitch , irregula or regular pattern sound when you sleep. May be accompanied by heavy breathing.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="causes">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h2>Causes of Snoring</h2>
       <h3>Muscle Tone of the Tongue</h3> 
       <p>During sleep the muscle tone in your tongue and soft palate tends to decrease. They become more relaxed and can collapse together. This contributes to snoring. Other soft tissues, such as tonsils and tongue, can produce sounds that add to or change the quality of the snoring. The position of the sleeper affects the amount of snoring. Lying on your back allows your tongue to fall back toward your throat and block your airway; so you are more likely to snore when you are lying on your back.</p> 
       <h3>Blockage of Airway</h3> 
       <p>Anything that obstructs your airway will also contribute to snoring. For example, you are more likely to snore if you have large adenoids or a large tongue or if your nasal passages are swollen from a cold or allergies. Enlarged tonsils and adenoids are the primary cause of snoring in children.</p> 
       <h3>Age and Other Factors</h3> 
       <p>Age is also a factor. Older people tend to snore more because muscle tone tends to decrease with age. Other factors also aggravate snoring; alcoholic beverages, certain medications, and sheer physical exhaustion may be associated with heavy snoring.</p> 
       <h3>Snoring Causes in Children</h3> 
       <p>There are many causes of snoring in children. However, keep in mind that snoring in very small children is not considered normal and medical help should be sought to diagnose the reason behind it. The most common causes of snoring in children are sinusitis and adenoid enlargement. The latter can be rectified with surgery which will remove both the adenoids and the tonsils. Sinusitis can be treated with antibiotics. Children who snore could often be suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Other possible causes of snoring in children are asthma, obesity, allergy attacks and the tonsils being swollen.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">

       </div> 
       <h2>Remedies for Snoring</h2>
       <h3>Lose Weight</h3> 
       <p>Maintain a normal weight - Losing weight can greatly reduce or even end snoring and possible obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Proper diet and exercise to losing weight.</p> 
       <h3>Avoid Smoking</h3> 
       <p>Don't smoke--period!! can cause increased nasal congestion and mucous in the throat area. Breathing through the nose is more effectual way to bring air into the lungs than mouth breathing.</p> 
       <h3>Reduce Alcohol Intake</h3> 
       <p>Alcohol can cause relaxation in the soft tissues and muscles in the throat. This will result in snoring or sleep apnea.</p> 
       <h3>Sleep on your Side</h3> 
       <p>Sleep on your side, it makes the snoring a little lower</p> 
       <h3>Other Remedies</h3> 
       <p>One effective stop snoring home remedy is to clear out nasal congestion. Nasal congestion causes snoring by building a vacuum in the throat. Use a humidifier to clear out the congestion so that you can get relief from snoring. Avoid the use of sedatives too. Sedatives depress the central nervous system which leads to excessive relaxation of the muscles and tissues in your throat. Sedatives are also linked to sleep apnea which is linked to cardiovascular disease. Keeping a regular is another good home remedy. Go to bed and wake at the same time each day. Plenty of sleep is a must as well. </p>
       <p> There are quite a few snoring remedies that work. For instance, lifestyle changes are a must if you want to stop snoring. Start exercising more and stop the intake of alcohol and cigarettes. In particular, avoid drinking before going to bed. Alcohol is known to relax the throat muscles and this results in the air passages being blocked even more. Another way that you can stop snoring is by getting a mouthpiece fitted. Breathing through the mouth also causes snoring and this can be prevented by a mouthpiece. You will have to contact your dentist who can then fit one for you. Another alternative is to purchase a nasal spray which you can spray at the back of your throat, tongue and uvula.</p>
       <p> <strong>Snoring Cures: During Pregnancy, Surgery -</strong> Research has shown that pregnant women snore more than women who are not. It is common to snore during pregnancy and here are some cures that can help prevent it. Wear a nasal strip as this will keep the airways open. Inhale steam before going to bed as this will clear up the nasal passages. It is essential to take steps to stop snoring during pregnancy as snoring in pregnancy can lead to sleep apnea. This is dangerous for both the mother and the fetus. If you continue to snore even after childbirth, you may want to look at laser surgery as a permanent solution to stop snoring. </p> 
       <strong>Snoring Solutions: Mouth Guards and Jaw Supporters -</strong> There are a number of reasons as to why people snore. These include illness, excess weight, and allergic reactions. A mouth guard is one way to prevent snoring. You can either visit your dentist who will measure your mouth and make a mouth guard for you. This is an expensive process so you may want to opt for trying on mouth guards that are available over the counter or at discount stores. A jaw supporter is also among the snoring solutions available to you. Studies show that tight clenched jaws lead to snoring. The jaw supporter works by keeping the lower jaw in an upward and forward position, so that the space of the airway can be increased. 
       <p></p>
       <p> <strong>Snoring Treatment Chin Strap Options:</strong> There are many snoring treatment options and these could either be non surgical or surgical. If you opt for the latter you might have to undergo a procedure called Uvulopalathopharyngoplasty (UPPP). This surgery removes excess soft tissues that are part of the tonsils, soft palate and so on. Other surgical procedures include Palatal Stiffening, Radio frequency ablation and Laser-assisted uvulopalatoplasty (LAUP). Non surgical options include as mentioned already, jaw supporters or a mouth guard, a nasal mask, nasal strips or even a chin strap. The chin strap is a simple headband that keeps your jaw closed as you sleep. </p>
       <p> Snoring is now a universal problem that is faced by both men and women. However, there are many snoring relief products which are now available. Some of these snoring relief products include a snore relief wrist band. This is a battery operated wrist band which detects various noises/changes that occur in the room. The device then sends electrical signals to soothe the nerves which are located in your wrist and get you to shift your position without waking up. A pillow for snore relief is also available. This pillow has a little groove in it, which allows you to hug the pillow. This makes it easier to sleep on your side and thus prevent snoring. </p>
       <p> A snoring mouthpiece is a small device that you put into your mouth and it pushes your jaw forward as you sleep. These can be custom made by your dentist or even ordered online or over the counter. Do ensure that you read up and do some research before you purchase such a mouthpiece. It would be wise to do a comparison of as well as read reviews on the different mouthpieces available to you.</p>
       <p> Here are some effective home remedies to tackle the problem of snoring in children. Identifying the cause behind the snoring will lead to treating it effectively. One of the common causes of snoring is obesity. If this is the reason behind the children snoring, ensure that they get enough exercise and start to lose the weight. Keeping the childs nasal passages free of congestion will help as well. Ensure they use a humidifier before sleeping. </p>
       <p> <strong>Natural Cures for Snoring:</strong> The well known natural cures for snoring include avoiding alcohol, smoking, sedatives , losing weight and so on. Another cure is to change the way you sleep, i.e. your sleep position. Sleeping on your side can help as it will prevent the base of your tongue and soft palate collapsing and thus prevent snoring. Try putting a pillow between your knees and one below your head to make sleeping on your side more comfortable. Remember that snoring can cause sleep disorders so it is best to take steps to control this problem before it leads to others.</p> ﻿

           <p>My husband had a horrible snoring problem, and being claustrophobic, could not use the breathing machine his doctor recommended. We came across marjoram oil as a cure. It has lowered the incidence and how loud he snores (he still does, but not as bad). On a scale of 1 to 10, he was a 15, now he's a 5.</p>
