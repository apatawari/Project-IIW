       <p>The ENT system is the Ear, Nose and Throat system. In the human body, these systems are interconnected. This may seem odd, because of the varied functions that these systems perform. However, it is their interconnection that helps them perform these functions. The ears for example each have a membrane that vibrates in response to sound waves. The inner side of the ear is connected to the nasal and oral cavities. This ensures that the air pressures in the ear canal and behind the membrane are equalized. Without this, the membrane would simply burst if there was a sudden increase in air pressure or a sudden burst of sound. </p> 
       <p>The nasal canal is used for respiration. It also performs various functions that ensure that harmful substances in the air which get trapped by the mucus present in the area. Respiration is linked with the oral cavity as well. Air can be breathed in through the mouth as well. This is often done when the nose is blocked with mucus or when the individual is breathing heavily due to physical exertion. The sinuses are also included in the ENT system as they are connected to the ENT system. </p> 
       <p>The throat is the area where both air and food intersect each other. Air is breathed in either through the mouth or the nose and is passed into the wind pipe. Food, consumed through the mouth, passes into the food pipe. The throat is also susceptible to a number of different infections and conditions. </p> 
       <p>The interconnected nature of these three systems is the reason why they are treated by one specialist. An ENT specialist is one who deals with problems relating to the Ear, Nose and Throat areas of the body, relating to hearing issues, breathing issues and speech related issues. An ENT disorder is any condition that affects these areas of the body.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="symptoms">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Symptoms of ENT Disorder</h2> 
       <p>The symptoms associated with ENT disorders depends entirely on the area that is affected. There are dozens of medical conditions that can affect the ENT system. Some of these will have common symptoms while others have their own unique symptoms. The most common symptoms of ENT disorders include pain in the ears, difficulty breathing, heaviness in breathing, sore throat, clogged nose and headaches. Headaches are usually associated with a sinus blockage when we speak of ENT disorder related headaches. There are other types of headaches that may be caused by non-ENT factors as well.</p> 
       <p>Most ENT disorders produce symptoms that are bearable for the individual. This is one reason why people often take time before they seek treatment for ENT conditions. It should be noted that ENT conditions can be harmful to the individual in the long term. This is specifically applicable to conditions that are associated with infections. If an infection damages the structures inside the ear, then it could lead to lifelong hearing loss. Hearing loss is also one of the symptoms associated with an ENT problem. If there is an inflammation of the ear canals it could restrict sound delivery. Inflammation of ear related organs can also cause hearing loss. ENT specialists are usually equipped with devices that can check an individuals hearing ability.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="causes">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Causes of ENT Disorder</h2> 
       <p>The variety of ENT disorders means that there is no one specific cause that these conditions can be attributed to. It is therefore best to separate the various conditions that could cause ENT disorders. Infections are the most common cause of ENT disorders. The human body is constantly bombarded with different infections that are airborne or waterborne. Some infections may also be received by the body through contact. Airborne infections are the most likely infections to cause ENT disorders. This is because the mouth and nose are in constant contact with air that flows through these areas. An airborne infection usually causes symptoms that include coughing and sneezing. People who are affected by airborne infections will experience mucus accumulation in their nasal passages and in the sinuses. This is the bodys way of trapping infectious materials that can then be expelled from the body. A blockage of mucus is likely to cause irritation to the individual. People who suffer from this condition may experience headaches, ear aches and general malaise. If the infection is more serious, the individual may suffer from fever and body ache as well.</p> 
       <p>ENT disorders may also occur if there is some structural abnormality or blockage in one of the canals. This type of condition is often difficult to diagnose and may require extensive scanning to be found. There may also be structural damage to some part of the ENT system that causes the disorder. This is common for people who suffer from ear related problems including hearing loss. Exposure to extreme loud sounds, especially sudden explosions of sound can cause structural damage to the ears.</p> 
       <p>There are also some genetic abnormalities that can cause problems with the ENT system. This is a common reason cited for hearing trouble. The genetic makeup of an individual may also determine his or her propensity for developing health problems with the ENT system. This would explain why some people tend to be more susceptible to ENT disorders while others are not as sensitive in this regard.</p>

       <h2>Remedies for ENT Disorder</h2> 
       <p>As explained above, there are dozens of different conditions that can affect the ENT system. Therefore, one needs to understand the condition first before seeking a remedy for it. There is a common home remedy used to deal with health problems that affect the nose and throat and even the ears. This involves the use of steam. Steam inhalation has been used for centuries as a method of clearing up clogged passages in the nose and sinuses. This can also have a beneficial effect on the ears as it may release any pressure imbalance that has been caused by a blockage of air flow through the nasal passages and the sinuses. In many cases, steam inhalation is used with the addition of essential oils or herbs to the water that has been boiled. This adds an aroma to the steam which is both pleasant and medicinal. Steam inhalation is something that is completely harmless which is why it should be used in cases where there is a sinus blockage.</p> 
       <p>For ear aches and infections, one might use warm oil. Garlic oil is known to be an anti-inflammatory substance. Warm oil may be poured into the affected ear in small drops. This treatment should not be performed if the oil is too hot to touch. Ear drops are often used if one seeks a medical option instead of a home remedy.</p> 
       <p>In some cases, conventional treatments are the best option when it comes to treating ENT disorders. This is particularly true when there is a thick blockage that needs to be manually irrigated. This commonly occurs when the ears are blocked with excess wax or when the sinuses are blocked with excess mucus. This process will be conducted in a clinic by trained medical professionals. Throat infections are among the most common, and because they are so widespread and frequently occurring, its best to treat them with home remedies. Gargling with salt water can help to clear any irritant from the throat. Gargling with salt water also helps to sooth the inflammation of the tonsils. The tonsils act as a barrier to prevent infections from entering the airways or the esophagus. One can also consume warm herbal drinks such as green teas to help sooth an irritated throat. The use of pepper and other condiments can be applied in such a case. Naturally, there are medical options as well for these health conditions which can be used under the direction of a trained doctor.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="diet">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Diet for ENT Disorder</h2> 
       <p>As such, there is no dietary restriction applied to someone suffering from an ENT disorder. One could say that the consumption of hot soups and drinks is helpful in such situations, but this may vary from individual to individual. ENT disorders that cause irritation or soreness of the throat may cause considerable difficulty when eating and in such situations too it would be advisable to restrict your diet to soft foods and soups, broths or herbal teas. Avoid foods that will aggravate the problem, like spicy and crunchy or oily foods, as well as extremely cold foods like ice creams.</p> 
       <p>It is always good to consume a healthy, balanced diet that is rich in vitamins and minerals. This can be beneficial to the overall health of the individual which will make it easier for him or her to recover from infection based problems that affect the ENT system. However, this is a general health recommendation and not one that directly influences the progression or recovery of ENT disorders.</p> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="suggestion"></a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Suggestions for ENT Disorder</h2> 
       <p>Patients who suffer from ENT disorders should not wait until the problem becomes bad. Very often we tend to brush off these issues, until they reach a stage where there is considerable discomfort to the individual. ENT disorders are usually resolved quite easily when the condition is at an early stage. This is especially true of those conditions that involve the development of a blockage. One must therefore visit an ENT specialist for consultation whenever there is some discomfort or abnormality experienced.</p> ﻿
