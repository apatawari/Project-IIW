       <!-- End Social Buttons Container --> Female sterility or infertility is said to occur when a woman is unable to get pregnant after trying unsuccessfully for at least a year. This is a common problem that affects a large number of couples who wish to have a child. Infertility is also likely to be diagnosed when a woman experiences repeated miscarriages. The cause of infertility may be attributed to various factors such as age, underlying medical conditions, diet and lifestyle. In some cases, the cause is never found while in others, multiple causes may be detected. Proper testing is required to determine the nature of the problem. This will pave the way for appropriate treatment.

       <h2>Symptoms of Female Sterility</h2> 
       <p>Most women realize that something is wrong when they are unable to get pregnant even after a year of having unprotected sexual intercourse. During that time, there may be no other symptoms. Some women may notice certain warning signs.</p>
       <ul> 
        <li> One of the most common symptoms of infertility is an irregular menstrual cycle. However this can be associated with many other conditions as well and hence a medical examination and testing is necessary to check for infertility. Menstrual bleeding that lasts from 3 to 7 days is considered normal. But if there are changes such as very light or heavy bleeding, then it is better to consult a doctor. Some women may also suffer from severe cramps during menstruation. </li> 
        <li> A womans chances of conceiving start diminishing as she advances in age. Therefore women, who have crossed the age of 35 and are unable to get pregnant after trying for six months should see a doctor soon. </li> 
        <li> Infertility may even be related to weight and being either overweight or underweight may be a cause or warning sign of infertility. </li> 
        <li> Recurrent miscarriages are another sign of female infertility and doctors usually make the diagnosis after three successive miscarriages have occurred.</li>
       </ul> 
       <div class="anchoralign">
        <a id="causes">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Causes of Female Sterility</h2> 
       <p>The causes of female sterility are varied. Some of the most common causes include:</p> 
       <li> </li>
       <li> Poor quality of the eggs</li> 
       <li> Scarring of the ovaries</li> 
       <li> Problems in the follicles which prevent rupture and release of the eggs</li> 
       <li> Blockages in the fallopian tubes due to infection, disease, ectopic pregnancy or congenital irregularities</li> 
       <li> Endometriosis, a condition in which the cells which line the uterus start growing outside of the womb. </li> 
       <li> Inability to produce mature eggs</li> 
       <li> Abnormalities in the uterus which make it difficult for the fertilized egg to implant itself into the uterine lining. </li> 
       <li> Problems in the functioning of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland which result in hormonal imbalances</li> 
       <li> Waiting too long to have children. Many studies suggest that the rates of female infertility appear to be rising. This can be attributed to the trend of having children at an older age.</li> 
       <li> Treatments such as radiation therapy</li> 
       <li> Exposure to certain toxins and chemicals</li> 
       <p> There are also some behavioral factors that can interfere with fertility.</p>
       <ul> 
        <li> Poor diet</li> 
        <li> Smoking</li> 
        <li> Alcohol consumption</li> 
        <li> Drug abuse</li> 
       </ul>
       <p> In some cases, the doctor may be unable to determine the cause of infertility. This is known as unexplained infertility. However even unexplained infertility can be treated successfully.</p>

       <h2>Remedies for Female Sterility</h2> 
       <p>The process of testing and diagnosing female sterility can continue for several months. This can be a stressful time and it is a good idea to have your doctor explain to you the various steps involved. This helps to paint a clearer picture of what to expect. Proper understanding of the nature of the tests may help to relieve feelings of anxiety. Most women then receive medications that can help to correct conditions associated with hormonal imbalances and ovulation issues. Many of these medications lead to side effects and therefore it is advisable to discuss their benefits and risks with your doctor beforehand. Some women also obtain benefits from home remedies for infertility. The effectiveness of home remedies can vary greatly, and most natural treatments for infertility have not been researched adequately. While youre waiting for those test results or doctors appointments, you could try out some home treatments however. Some of the most common natural home remedies for fertility are as follows:</p>
       <ul> 
        <li> Dry the root of a banyan tree in the sun and then grind into a powder. Add about half a cup of milk and drink in the morning. This remedy is said to help in alleviate fertility problems in women. It must not be consumed during menstruation. The treatment is said to work best when continued for six months. Do keep in mind that this is just a folk remedy, used primarily in the Indian subcontinent and there is no scientific basis for these claims. </li> 
        <li> Consume egg plant along with buttermilk for a period of two months. </li> 
        <li> In treating infertility in women, natural remedies made with herbs are also helpful. The herb, winter cherry, may be powdered and consumed along with milk. </li> 
        <li> Black cohosh is a popular herb for female sterility because of its positive effects on menstruation. It is also thought to encourage proper implantation of the fertilized egg.</li> 
        <li> Dong quai is another herb that helps to regulate menstruation. However, it should not be used during the days of menstrual bleeding since it has blood thinning properties. You can prepare a decoction of dong quai by adding a couple of teaspoons of the herb to a cup of boiling water. Brew for about ten minutes and then drink.</li> 
        <li> Chaste berry helps to balance hormonal levels in the body by focusing on the pituitary gland. It is beneficial for women who experience problems in ovulation because of high prolactin levels. Chaste berry is available in the form of capsules, liquid extract or tinctures. You may also consume the dried berries.</li> 
        <li> The uterine lining can be strengthened by consuming a mixture of red raspberry leaves and warm water. This remedy must be discontinued once conception occurs.</li> 
        <li> Many women find massage therapy to be effective in encouraging natural conception. Some have even found that it increases the chances of pregnancy after fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization. Massage helps to regulate menstruation and ovulation. </li> 
        <li> A beneficial remedy for the management of problems related to female physiological system such as uterine fibroids is warm castor oil massage on the abdominal area. Ginger compresses are also believed to help in relieving pain arising from fibroids.</li> 
       </ul>
       <p> Because of the various possible causes of infertility, the treatments or remedies that are appropriate will also differ greatly from one case to another. Most of these home remedies are unlikely to be of much help until an accurate diagnosis is made, and until we have a better understanding of the action of these remedies.</p>

        <a id="diet">&nbsp;</a>
       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Diet for Female Sterility</h2> 
       <p>Your diet doesn't really have a direct effect on fertility levels, unless there are certain contaminants or toxins in foods that affect fertility. Under normal circumstances a healthy balanced diet is all you need to follow, to ensure that you do not suffer from any health conditions or diseases that may cause sterility. Female fertility can be improved by making certain changes in the diet. In addition to following a healthy balanced diet plan you could make some modifications to your diet. </p>
       <ul> 
        <li> Fruits and vegetables are rich in antioxidants which help to enhance reproductive health. Many fruits and vegetables such as green leafy vegetables and citric fruits are also high in folate which is an important nutrient for pregnant women.</li> 
        <li> Healthy fats such as monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids may also help increase female fertility. These fats are found in avocados, nuts and seeds.</li> 
        <li> In case your diet is deficient in any essential nutrients it would be a good idea to consult your doctor or nutritionist for advice on nutritional supplements. Avoid self medication even with supplements, as over dosage with nutrients like vitamins and minerals can also put you at considerable risk.</li> 
       </ul>
       <p> There are also foods which should be avoided as they may affect fertility levels in women. These include:</p>
       <ul> 
        <li><strong> Seafood that is High in Mercury:</strong> Mercury can contribute to birth defects. It is advisable to consult your doctor regarding specific varieties of fish and seafood that are appropriate for consumption. Do not completely eliminate fish or seafood from your diet as they are a rich source of essential nutrients like omega 3 fatty acids.</li> 
        <li><strong> Caffeinated Beverages:</strong> Too much caffeine can hamper conception and may also increase the risk of miscarriages.</li> 
        <li><strong> Alcohol:</strong> This can lead to problems in the functioning of the ovaries. Intake of alcohol during pregnancy can also result in spontaneous abortion and may also increase the risk of growth and developmental problems in the fetus.</li> 
        <li><strong> Fast Foods:</strong> These are loaded with sodium and unhealthy fats that can contribute to weight gain, which may in turn lead to infertility. </li> 
        <li><strong> Artificial Sweeteners:</strong> These are known to raise the risk of infertility and birth defects.</li> 
        <li><strong> Foods Wrapped in Plastic or kept in Plastic Containers:</strong> The toxins contained in plastic can pass on to the food and into your body, thereby interfering with fertility levels.</li>
       </ul> 
       <div class="anchoralign">

       </div> 
       <h3></h3>
       <h2>Suggestion for Female Sterility</h2> 
       <p>Before you investigate and look into health problems that may contribute to infertility it would be a good idea to make modifications to your lifestyle, eliminating unhealthy habits that could increase the risks of infertility. Maintain a healthy lifestyle with a disciplined routine, giving yourself adequate rest and sleep to recuperate. Avoid situations and conditions that cause excessive stress as far as possible and take up meditative practices and relaxation techniques to keep stress at bay. Unhealthy habits like smoking put you at great risk of infertility. If you do wish to conceive at some point of time, it would be a good idea to quit smoking right away. The use of certain over the counter medications, particularly birth control and hormonal medications to control your menstruation can also interfere with fertility levels.</p> ﻿

           <p>Everyone who has fertility problems should try a cure of barley green fresh juice for 21 days. Drink 2 times daily, 30 minutes before meals. Mix 50ml of barley green fresh juice with 200ml of water. If you can't find fresh barley juice in your organic stores area you can replace it by making a cure of Barley grass powder (it is as good as the fresh juice).&nbsp; Consume half to 4 teaspoons per day, it can be added to smoothies, juice, water, rice milk, yogurt or any other foods. Barley green is a great natural remedy for infertility, increases sperm production and quality, boosts fertility and is also a wonderful natural body cleanser!</p>
